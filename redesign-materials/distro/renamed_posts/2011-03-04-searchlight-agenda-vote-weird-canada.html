<b>CBC Radio 3</b> is running a pyramidal <a href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/searchlight/" target="_blank"><u>voting scheme</u></a>, vetting <b>Weird Canada</b> through a triumvirate of keystrokes, sinusoids, and opinionated minds. A conspiracy of this calibre must be met with deep suspicion and deliberate candor. They pit us against each other - our fellow publishers. They split our fans - those beautiful beings. They place the unbearable suffering of expectation on all who speak their name. Ye wyld typists vie for the last shard of national recognition. 

Our radio Narsil has us deep in the trenches, spending weeks at your foot begging for another integer. In the heat of the mud no ideal will last. <b>All</b> succumb to it. Thick. Greasy. Swelling with the rainbows of fallen candidates. In the beginning we shouted "No! This voting scheme shall not stand! Free it all! Let the streets run wild with the multitude of our opinions!" But now, as the <a href="" target="_blank"><u>blue skies turn black</u></a>, I face you filled with the adrenaline of conviction. We believe. We want to win. We write these very words to justify our victory grip.

Thanks to your support, the absurd notion that <b>Weird Canada</b> may win has become a reality. We have blown away all the flagpoles and are staring blankly into the void. The Top 10. Why is this important? Why does this matter? Win or not, Weird Canada will remain an exploratory experience for the brazenly adventurous. We will always focus on our northernly kin and enthuse, physically scan, and hyperbolize all the wonderful manifestations of creative potential this country has to offer. Our <a href="" target="_blank"><u>daily operation</u></a> will continue, delightedly, into the unheralded cassette oblivion. 

However, the Canadian psyche is shifting. Winning this contest may push it further into our camp. The middle ground of indie music is disappearing. The plates are grooving under due pressure from self-recorded geniuses and the industry <s>cannot</s> will not handle it. So we've come to you, our people from coast-to-coast, to ask for your vote. A vote along the streams of time. A vote for the only entity proudly bearing the emerging flag of a new <b>northern identity</b>. An identity not born in the offices of minor-majors, but one bursting with the charged, chromatic life festering within tape dubbers, cd burners, pressing plants, and photocopy machines.

We. Are. Northernly.
