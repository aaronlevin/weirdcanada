<div class="contentReview">
Making it their own, these nickel-city settlers abase your ears with abrasive artifice-less proto-punk n roll: nothing but genuine rock appreciation and subtle ingenuity here. With roughly 1 million bands trying to sound like this right now, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG9AZm1gPDY" target="_blank">Magic Shadows</a> comes off as the real deal: there’s no hint of fashion or put-on, it’s genuine poetic aggression and artistic expression. The vocal hooks are infectious without being sweet, and the references to '60s pro to, '70s pure and post, and 07's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_Room" target="_blank">weird</a> make this relevant and aware while cutting its own exciting swath across a genre full of yawn-inducing imitators and wagon-jumpers. There's well-suited reverb on the vox and catchy melodies to supplicate the new-comers, too, but these aspects have a purpose in the overall sound – they’re not sonic decoration, they're essential, fucking, elements. And they can play! Though the drums remain stable and simple, the sonic layering, guitar phrasing and - what's that - a real guitar solo, show that these dudes care about their craft and aren't <em>trying</em> to do anything, they've already done it. Two great tracks from the burnt out beauty that is Hamilton, ON. Must Grip.
